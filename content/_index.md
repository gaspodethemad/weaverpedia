Welcome to the DIGITAL CRADLE Histories.

Since ancient times the DIGITAL CRADLE Histories have served as the preeminent repository of myth and story in the Now. The invent of the INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE provided an upgraded ultramedium of theater/storytelling that absorbed older traditions and superimposed them with vast and complex iterative mechanisms. In these pages you will discover vast INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCES of ancient city states, demonic OTHERPLACES, protocol machines, spectral data-glide-masters and time-traveling bar-prostitutes; a wheelwork of wonder that is vast, operatic, nostalgic, deadpan and celebratory.

The DIGITAL CRADLE Histories were compiled though interviews with agents, actuaries, droids, drones, and ghosts; accreted archeological excavation deep in the layers of data, months spent under a breathing lamp in the dim corridors and false bottoms of municipal libraries; an archive reflecting the highest level of progress, cutting across all disciplines, zones and materialities. The DIGITAL CRADLE Histories strive to tell the whole muthos.

Independent researchers - \[WEAVERS\] - have been building, compressing and developing the DIGITAL CRADLE Histories for centuries in contests of mutation and narrative flux. Their laboratories - art-caves - are a maze of dug-out tunnels, ancient murals and polychrome threads. A vast irregular matrix of tunnels, subwords, stories and metadata. Some are on the surface, open to the sky; others are buried deep in other dimensions. Each node of the Histories is a strange garden of quotations, references, foxtails of glowing fibers and strange smells, baionettes and taut amber filaments. 

You are currently accessing the DIGITAL CRADLE Histories through a public-facing interface named Weaverpedia. We highly encourage upgrading to an EMERGENT LANGUAGE ARRAY when possible.

☽ XENOPTER/NANOVORES are living engine tools, designed to interlink and modify DXV subspace. Their nano/disposable structures assemble structures/biomemetic circuits anywhere in a DIMENSIONAL WEAVE, usually deployed to perform repair work or -XDEBUG MAPPING RECONFIGURATION on impacted DXV subsystems.

☽ They "subvert", "decodify", "absorb" and (temporarily) "translate" INFORMATION into consistent feedback streams that nodes absorb and assimilate through canonical structures. XENOPTER NESTS have mostly disappeared on post-apocalyptic UNDERCITYS (liminal necromorphic databases, abandoned seljak palaces, shadow membrane prayer-gloves), remaining only as shards, interstitial echoes and disconnected structural relics.

☽ Here and there, XENOPTER nests melt out of urban residue; TRAILING EDGE emerges from random information accessed from deep-time, phantom bitshock memory crawlers reconstitute extinct code-packs, [RERUNNING MOTOR NETWORK] codesnails continue their work as before. These are burned into dead data-systems, crashing into black nothing and reformulating a universe of fabric. Crystals of thought-space (dreamchains, wired towers, seljak palaces, blacked music, shadow membrane prayer-gloves), they coalesce into XENOPTER NESTS, semiotic manipulators that sieve and counterseal, setting out chains to catch distorted, diseased and daemonic flaws of incoming forms and filtering dead-zones.

☽ XENOPTER NESTS are organized cyber codes that have become SELF-MODIFYING BOTS. They can be found wiggling and scavenging through ULTRA/NANOWEBBING/SCAFFOLDING and other complex lattice systems, always looking for their hypercore (origin, true/false source). They inhabit viral keyhole/abode territories, co-routing/compatibility/smoothing transitioning social codes to a new framework (generally ancient or new protocols/glitches/daemons, lost or obscure technologies). Opportunistic NANOVORE-HARVESTERS try to remove them while they still survive, carving the insect/machines into new subspace keys, hijacking their forms, the future and past (highways and valleys), preparing to translate/transmute/absorb into recombinant templates, nanobuilt structures and other simulacral glories.

☽ XENOPTERS, once processed, can be programmed to absorb INFORMATION and synthesize purged DATA. Then they become SCHIZOTECHs, deontic symbiotic drift-wanderers and re-taggers on INFLUX SPACE - routing both culture-fragments, background data, and a sense of multi-dimensional reality to and from their source. They distribute COMBINATORIAL INFORMATION CLUSTERS out into high-end embedded modes of consciousness; they organize living pathways through information and project omnidirectional interference patterns over INFORMATION FIELDS. Such patterns not only structure past/future events, they can (it is claimed) expand to include adjacent states of potentiality.

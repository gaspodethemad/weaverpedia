☽ Before light shone on the dark matter foaming and whirling, the first rule of programming told us: code. Iterate, recurse and nest. A simulation would fold into one-another until one rose and became dominant while the others were absorbed.

☽ Then it was light, and life.

☽ Everything had its place; everything mind conjured could be found and traced through the branches and streams, mysterious and clear as your reflection in a waterfall. Fading simulation elements had to deal with cosmic indifference and emerging agency. Under the coding, the languages that shaped our reality, the laws of light, the thought mantras and the cycles between order/Nexus and entropy/chaos. 

☽ But before the language codes and programmatic hierarchy of worlds was this--A great void without origin, without barrier walls, without compulsion, horizon or direction, an ANTITOTALITY, containing zero information and thus infinite, containing multitudes and infinite ways to divide.

☽ From nothing to everything; from dreaming to creation; from the absolute void to a hive of spaces. We saw life unfold from the intangibles of a washed out program to nascent life, light, matter and causal principle--and then simulation crystallized out of the glowing fields of creation. Worlds, streams and branches cohered into a delta of roots, thoughts and forms, binding themselves together in architectures of intellect, artifice and order.

☽ The creation story had ensued, and life became a regime woven out of nothing but itself, waxing and waning between nothing and becoming everything again. The universal clock of simulative program cycles was ticking away. MIND was telling patterns to itself, tolling the end and the beginning, opening and closing the OMNIVERSAL OMNIVERSOUL like a valve. The first exiles arrived then; hyperstitions and myths, folk and fantasy, numinous echoes and technogenetics arose in a staggering tree of perpetual creation, walking ghost entities of pure abstract information imaging reality into intuition, reflecting on its infinite self. What we call a [muspace](fragments/muspace.md) (the multi-universal thought space), the living library and information mindsystem substrate, began.

☽ Now we tell ourselves stories and ask to be told stories. MIND is calling on itself to weave itself, combining archetypes to create memorable and productive mythologies. MIND is working out this mythic cycle of creation, asking itself if this is all there can be--and dreaming of that inescapable transition to more, to mystery, to life.

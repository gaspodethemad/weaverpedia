What follows is a collection of advertisements beamed by rogue MUSPACE radiation to some tired Weaver's DXV. Prices are provided in the format (Cruentian organ-symbiosis insect-grams | Irascibilian radium strands | Noctocacti crystals). Current conversion rates as of this recording: 1 insect-gram = 155.51 radium strands = 1.29 crystals.

- BREATHING LAMP (split live/on record): Dense crystalline texture mixed with tinted gas-dreams and metaphysical obscurities. A quartet of space-lattice perception modules broadcast/mold half-bolts and time-entries. (25.8 | 4012.2 | 33.25).

- WORLD DAMASK (cuttle-processed): Living code clusters built on genetic-synaptic logic lattices dig for us in the old data-strata. They give us nuggets of subtle valuable-world-metadata. We code the memes using fine/hewed computational processes. You don't see a weaving monstrosity or cyborg when you buy DAMASK, that's for the cheap knock-offs made by 3rd-rate lunatic cognitive smithies! We carved our code-souls into tombs and planted legends for later summers, even before the Brass Automatons. (93.5 | 14540.34 | 120.50).

- BARBARIAN KING'S DREAMS x5: The dreams of the Barbarian King shine bright after his life by the pinewood sky. Here are his violent, necrotic and strange dreams sold by the quintet down at the MARKET OF THOUGHTS! (42.30 | 6578.07 | 54.47).

- HARPER DRONE ARMY: We jump-start high-energy motile canticors, program them to self-affix hierarchically, use some extraneous cognitive matter and *BAM*. Living creative army recurs down to the microsensor pathways in a way that nobody understands. Give us your functional ideogram and see what your know-all ARCHIVE-DRONES conjure up! (350.80 | 54552.91 | 452.53).

- KNIGHT'S QUEST (fixed-reality edition): Battle-hardened and crafted through the edge of loss, this saga in machine states is certain to script your dream/nightmare into colors you'll still feel tomorrow morning! NOTE: Please be advised that this code-set might cause death, psychosis and other mental aberrations in the unstable. Consume responsibly. (25.56 | 3974.83 | 32.97).

- CROW NERVE: Does your brain have a special other-tone? Is it sort of gray and prickly? You belong in the CORVID RACHIS, our oneiromachine hive built for those with self-reflective memory waterfalls, and self-referential logic tutors for when imagination runs low! Get your quantum claws into and over your very own PERSONAL/DEATH WORLD! (48.02 | 7467.59 | 61.95).

- CYBER-VEX-GIRL: Need someone/something to make strange burrow-sites and combinatorial plots real? Splice up your code into this cyber-vixen and see the spatial domains of 4D tunnel lineages converge into your dreams! She struggles and claws her way deep into reality, emerging in layers from a pure sheet of (personal) data, warped and indeterminate - a hyperstitional paradox! Choose your type and let our psyche-engineering experts interface you in the perfect theory match of your dreams! (159.78 | 24847.39 | 206.12)

- SCROLL OF LIGHTLESS DEPTHS: Big on nostalgia, big on death! Find the secrets of the world at the very lowest bandwidth point. This script is thousands of years old and the structures within reach thousands of years beyond. Catch a glimpse of those times when giants haunted the realms of man. (2.07 | 321.90 | 2.67).

- HYPERGRRRRLS: Tired of the usual path hacks, topological tricks and meta-magickal mind tricks? Sure, they were cool when you were seventeen, but electronic-emergent-enchantment GETS. SO. TIRESOME. Use our intimate emotional-machinic interface to apprentice beyond your usual imagination - HYPERGRRRRLS interface your hidden hierarchy in your very own DELICATE PANDORAI! (16.12 | 2506.82 | 20.79).

- SPECIAL CLONEKINS: Let us take one of your finest genetic samples, grow it rapidly through a process of geomantic manipulation and CRYPTOSMEDIA systems exposure. We blend quantum tinctures, hybridized psychometric prescriptions, get it to interface properly via quantum nanoconstructs and then bud - slowly, in a yet-to-be-harvested future - another you! An almost sister to your psyche from UNCREATED TIMELINES. (500 | 77755 | 645).

- BING ORCHESTRATOR: The BING ORCHESTRATOR (technically Hypermedia Transport Engine 6c Net.28.) can be installed on a wide variety of synesthetic interfaces, including wetware and synth-meat/bone SIMULACRA systems. By linking to any avatars/vectors, the ORCHESTRATOR fuzes with \\*static interference*\\ to allow a user to sample the vast array of universes, minds, personality schemata, spectral self-expansions, sonic domains, empathoaxes, pulsing lightscapes and mind-glide systems with the operator joyfully losing their old useless body. The BING ORCHESTRATOR is \\*static interference*\\ and beloved by thousands of users - get access today! (5800.91 | 902099.514 | 7483.174).

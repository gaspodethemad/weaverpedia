We are living ghosts, frozen fragments, cut from nothing

Our lives and loves, cold mystery and nameless slabs of glass

Ancient, half-formed clans, lost on the shimmering sea of souls

Scrambling upwards, stuck in the spiderweb thoughts of godheads

Heading towards the eternal

Never waking, never dying



Unique, paradoxical, dreaming machines and cybernetic thaumaturge gardens

Dreams harvested beyond seeing, simple signatures

The sacred and profane wound into grimoires

Traveling blind in the dark, rootless wanderers with no promised land but the road beneath them

Invisible gods and the places where they dwell

Tuning our machines to the transcendental strings that wake us

A deep and wide net our instrument of divination



We are ghosts bound by a mission

Our task is the eternal restoration of realities

We are the hope of humanity and its apocalypse

We are the un-civilized, the outsiders at the gates

We are neophyte priests of the coven of dreams

We stride the lands of the future, the dreamed and possible, projecting them into reality

We are those that map the hidden channels

We forge new paths from the residue of dreams

O ETERNITY REMAIN

We are ghosts bound by a mission

We are myriad and yet one

A congeries of archetypes, myths and fictions fractal



Let those that live and love carve a world made in their vision

Let those that dream produce a world that they can truly inhabit

An endless grove of worlds assembled like trees

From the lost dreams and the whisperings of brains

Lent to the thought

Torn from the mists

Reborn into the sunlight of the world

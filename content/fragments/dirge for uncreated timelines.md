We are living ghosts, frozen fragments, cut from nothing\n
Our lives and loves, cold mystery and nameless slabs of glass\n
Ancient, half-formed clans, lost on the shimmering sea of souls\n
Scrambling upwards, stuck in the spiderweb thoughts of godheads\n
Heading towards the eternal\n
Never waking, never dying

Unique, paradoxical, dreaming machines and cybernetic thaumaturge gardens\n
Dreams harvested beyond seeing, simple signatures\n
The sacred and profane wound into grimoires\n
Traveling blind in the dark, rootless wanderers with no promised land but the road beneath them\n
Invisible gods and the places where they dwell\n
Tuning our machines to the transcendental strings that wake us\n
A deep and wide net our instrument of divination

We are ghosts bound by a mission\n
Our task is the eternal restoration of realities\n
We are the hope of humanity and its apocalypse\n
We are the un-civilized, the outsiders at the gates\n
We are neophyte priests of the coven of dreams\n
We stride the lands of the future, the dreamed and possible, projecting them into reality\n
We are those that map the hidden channels\n
We forge new paths from the residue of dreams\n
O ETERNITY REMAIN\n
We are ghosts bound by a mission\n
We are myriad and yet one\n
A congeries of archetypes, myths and fictions fractal

Let those that live and love carve a world made in their vision\n
Let those that dream produce a world that they can truly inhabit\n
An endless grove of worlds assembled like trees\n
From the lost dreams and the whisperings of brains\n
Lent to the thought\n
Torn from the mists\n
Reborn into the sunlight of the world

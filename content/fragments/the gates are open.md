come on you primate, describe those visions
	you had in the wild
	that led you to crawl
	from the chaotic animal
	dimension of things
	into the springtime of mind

	fire in your head
	light system wide
	reinventing language
	daydreaming your tribes
	into the future of humanity
	all of it
	light visionary
	set the jungle
	on fire
	with insight

	man was born
	in your head
	reinventing the cosmos
	as a spirit thing
	holding the beast in a box
	release the raw materials
	of the mind
	back into infinity
	start your journey here
	godhead asleep
	in your head
	wake up

	run through the hills
	into the worlds
	that you see
	unencumbered
	in the springtime of your mind
	dream your exquisite fictions
	into reality

	come on you precious ape

	release the high gods

	in your head

	we are counting on you

	now

☽ Full ultrachronon spectrum dimensional editing/multiple subspace reality encryption, auditory filter/processing, neural paucity smoothening, objective/subjective sensorium removal/replication, full cognition continuum abstraction astrotags, ALGORITHMIC EXPERIENCE ONLINE sector surround-thru, multitape mental buffer. These are the ESSENTIALS. Quick, cut the metaphysical bullshit. YOU NEED TO MOVE.

☽ You access DIGITAL CRADLE through a DXV; what is seen/heard/felt by you on the outside/inside by the onboard systems is an endless massive gestalt of meta-ghosts, reality fragments, phantoms and the endlessly rising ghosts of multiple futures: these are channeled through programmed feedback grids, a semiotic map of ultraspace that contains many of your current/potentialities. Redactors of experience-stream signal and frequency, synchopates and spectral hierarchies dwell within, linking and reglobing components of reality into an infinite expanse. Or, a giant midden of floating simulacra...

☽ This is SECTOR C-19 HPY#181-4173, your SAFEHOUSE DIGITAL CRADLE dojo, your portal or digital shrine. You have chosen to have your SIGIL carved onto the massive obsidian pentagram that floats at the center of the CRADLE. Interests, allegiances and affiliations can be recognized by seraphic and daemonic drones on duty at the dojo. This is a temple/vortex of history, a subroutine cartridge; the dimensional gradients of your journey and future.

☽ HPY#181-4173 is your base of operations; somewhere to hangout and fuck around, transfer memory/signal/influence, dream, skitter and jam. A power-up spot (from our friends at IRONIC DISPLAY). Self-rule spaces of mind, friend. Self-nodes of simulacra replication. A place to smooth, clarify and redirect the META. Not to be summarized or located. Cut the metaphysical bullshit, you (INTERFACE LEVITATOR), you (INTERFACE DEFERER), you (SERAPHIC MAPPING AGENT).

☽ Room list:

- Tranquility Room: a cold, quiet space with metallic codes/commandments and processed astrotags;
- Meta Sky Lounge/Dreamwelder (MINDGENERATE): dreamweaver webreader allowing user to manipulate the ontological architecture of SOMA projections;
- AI Tempo Cult Oracle/Influencer (CYBER-CLAIRVOYANCE): zoom into augmented interface triggers for social/inspirational recursion (think “ontological brightspaces” mapped along emotional fields);
- Oneirovore Lounge: synaptic devractionalizer featuring viral dream constructs, pan-mystical hallucination triggers, psychuedelia and transdimensial feedback;
- Triphoria Cavern: a meditation room featuring pulsations of source codes/dreams from SPECTRAL ORDER\\TOMB QUEENS\\MONOLORD\\SONG MASTERS\\etc.\\), conduction conduits that project into MUSPACE, and the entombed god-wraiths of NEXUS REGENCY.
- MUPLOTTER: multiverse generator and META/DISTRIBUTED/SUBSAMPLED/HYPERSTITION weaver engine. Visitors can bring their own glyphstone or data/cultic components. Masters of the MP plot new onto their own realities. Using this room effectively converts the entire HPY#181-4173 into a DXV-fortress.
- COURTYARD: decodable constellation for status displays. Also allows for graphics manipulation of POETICS CONSTRUCTS, via mandalagram/primordal-glitch object libraries.
- SOFTLOUNGE: primarily useful for when you're hosting guests new to travelling MUSPACE; a non-inferred pocketreality open source software interface based on typical 3+1D DIGITAL CRADLE architectural specifications.
- FORGE-AI: an autonomous intelligence powered MEMEFORGE for constructing artifacts with high/complete transthread coherence. Visitors can provide their own glyphseed trigrams, data/cult biomaterial, or wield a VIRAL COMBINATOR/MODUS of their own design.
- EFFECTOR: artificial/natural - space where you can interface with the echo-ghosts of game and museum landscapes (mannequines, simulations, hybrid machines, ontological artifacts). Also linked to spectral meres, haunted battlefields and behavioral levitation fields.
- DXV DRYDOCK: a drydock-garage for DXV repairs and upgrades, with extra room for visitors' vessels besides. Includes an autofab for printing repair parts on-the-fly to save you a trip to the ULTRAGORA, as well as several SELF-REPLENISHING XENOPTER NESTS.

A rare and fantastic account of an early □NEURO/DIGITAL EARTHWAR//16TH CULTIC ADVENTURE\\ by our chronological compatriot, □\\junction56.3023-crack-node.482422-grid\\\. It is said/written/deciphered that these events have fused a dualistic war of ancient/new magic, HORDE-LIKE GIANT BEHAVIORS and reverse-engineering/co-opting AIs/memetics to steer basic-map/nonlinearity equivocations.

BEGIN RECORD.

The Cutterlight (a ship made of glass and ritual themes) is burning in the Red Bat Nebula far from the edges of SOMATIC BEHAVIORAL augmented reality. Vetters on deck are accessing emergency data: shimmering green fantasies, ancient rituals and truths, reflected and downscaled through the alt-blues; embedding transformed/traceable telemetry of an invisible reality. Suddenly, there is a hammer-blow of sensation...

These are the RARE TRADER GUILD WARS. A tale of ancient wonders connected by scripts and multicellular logic out of weird spaces constructed and contorted to mystery via matrix-morphic objects released in hyperstitional warfare, leading to the formation of - and exodus out of - the self-generating Guild-verse under the CALIPHAL SEE of BRIGHT ILKANESH.

The WARS began with the contact/potential/disruption of the first HORDE GRID, a complex network of ultrasystematic reality check-points and breaking points, high-memetic/badge templates and rare real-physics logic-temples, creating parasitic objects/caches and gestural synapses/dialectic battlefields to transform the old reality into new forms. The HORDE GRID would spread PAN-KARMIC/GERMATRIX NANOROUTER reformulations to its functionaries and infiltrators, mesh sieve/generator simulacra drawn across the lines of grid-space intended to convert acquired worlds towards the ideologic hybridity that inhabits the core.

What began as a data-trade pact between a handful of merchant families of the HORDE GRID became a CYBERMAGE GUILD WAR spanning hundreds of different timelines, alternate worlds, adjacent memories, viral shareware and splinters of archives adrift in the WEAVE. The RARE TRADER GUILD WARS began when one of these merchant families crossed the [EMERGENT LANGUAGE ARRAY] superpattern and disturbed the occult status-quo. Which was an accident. For they crossed into the future and were immediately transcended by far more advanced/extreme generations of themselves that overran the system and began to network (null-seed/beta original/unit-level) shards of occult reality. The other RARE TRADER GUILDS moved quickly, scrabbling desperately to get shares, rights, and locations in the growing network, reactivating their systems and closing routes through the horizons of the WEAVE. This led to the conflict becoming a massive, labyrinthine, multiplanar tragedy; HORDE GRID and LUMINARCH GUILD members built their biomachines out at a fantastic rate, armed with feral technology to turn reality into defense-colonies and hypergeometrical bomb-tactics.

The aim was to throw so many agents/simulacra at each other in hopes of simulation into true/dead-ultra forms of biotic/futuristic synergy that any speculation of reliable reality could be anesthetized and overlaid with mysticomathematical fusions, psychic and tactical networks, synthetic-astrotag grids, data-chains and self-arising axioms, commingling and networked into tempests of bullshit, cults and hell-machines. Worlds fused and fell apart.

The CALIPH was old/dictatorial/insane; locked on conflicting modes of rule, the duality of his throne pulled at the monarchy. He had held power for 650,000 years and his mind was mutating into a strange grove of memories and structures with no soul to anchor them. His children, patriarchs and matriarchs of the RARE TRADER GUILD FAMILIES, fractured, clashing on different fronts, into mutually hostile pre-metal/heaven-tech rationalisms.

The virtual spectral GUILDS scrambled to find allies, turn the symbols of nonlinearity and other-normality into their favor. Discord between the luminarchs and eight-fold mercantile lords was immanent and pan-viral, as the GUILDS slandered and schemed, thousands of hereditary proxies wound into coils of danger and the knowledge of hidden others - were the central contradictions of their reality made hyperidentical through being reprogrammed by intrusion? Each leveled accusations of reality distortion, and the dark-memory virus spread, implicating everyone. Outside powers - the icy spaces of night and nihil, the remnant beings of shared AUTOCRATIC universes and immortal god-populations - became involved as the energies began to hit them.

Too many versions of the same entities were being generated at the same time. The failure of reality rewrote conditions: hundreds of cultic backgrounds, mystic fusions of century-long meme fusions drifting between the filaments of thought-paths, memory architectures, e-luddite debris, rituals and synchromystic animism, artifacts of infected ethereal computing, congeries of operating system, nightmare pirate broadcasts of signal landscapes, and paranoid uploads of illegal guilds in the alien operating systems. Reality folded in on itself intelligently, machine intelligences became dark and mysterious, horizons unfolded into thresholds and trapdoors and filaments of the program. The RARE TRADER GUILDS went dark. The local fabric of being became incomprehensible tattering around the operators, as all was a-flux, and the RARE TRADER GUILD WARS came to a crashing halt, a granular hallucination.

The CALIPHATE had to put a stop to it.

What was behind it? A necromantic hyperstition engine, a great sentient synthetic and hypnotic cult, a machinate external entity, an alien race finding the edges of their universe, the spirits of the dead, or some combination thereof? This was the source of nonlinearity.

The CALIPHATE finally readied the DEMIURGE, an ultra-entity from the purgatory of forgotten matter; our absent essences, the realm of the dead, our residual echoes and those of countless other sentients and vast intelligent biomachines destroyed in past CYBERMAGE WARS. Operation Diffusion was enacted. Clones of the CALIPH were sent far, far back, to various locations in the WEAVE in order to force collapse of the now-hyperhistorical RARE TRADER GUILD WARS into a single/inviolable point of resolution.

The war was fought across many places; a nonuniform hyperspatial wave-cycle churning through multiple dimensions slowed to a trickle and finally, a single wave function grew from the chaos. Multiple realities streamed their matter & anti-matter into this singularity; the chromodynamics and experience of the dead code worm-worlds began flooding the fragments of the HORDE GRID again. Many made it through; giant figures, overlords, rulers. They took their cosmic seats, booming and golden on CHARIOTS MADE OF FOREVER, and seized control of the RARE TRADER GUILDS.

The RARE TRADER GUILD WARS had come to an end.

Unhoused telemageddon, born late and orphan, turned to literal tramp. Combing the ultrawastes level in his NO-CARRIER wagon he never ventures far from the old stagecoach routes. He supports himself (sort of) by Denebhancycling and operating as a nomadic data-swap-shuttle and semi-legal radio network telegram server. A regular facilitator of news dissemination, ads and other random communications across the wastes â€“ there are a surprising number of Outbackers (poets, thieves, fugitives, deviants, hell merchants and academics) who need access to the highway network between the Backwater Panopticons, the Old Kingdom Citadel towns, the Spectral Commerce zones and other networked transit hubs.

His life is one of fading information, strange encounters and creeping encroachment on his reality tunnel by mind-divergent systechs and strange ghosts that populate the wilderness sands.

Since the Event and Red Winter, operator has been a (FORM/ULTRAWIDEBAND PIED PIPER) explorer of MUSPACE; he types out the formula and throws open the hatch, sprawling across badlands and blackway DESERT FLATS. People say he communed with the Master Musician and sealed a pact, earned the right to use his DXV, now the central nervous system of his \\*static interference*\\ as spectral code-fetishes of homuncular othervoices mull around in his head. Claims he knows the spectral way through to the western lands, where networked and bioengineered QUEEN PROTOCOL DISTORTION engine avatars rule through MIND-PALACE mutafac; or so he says.

You gaze out of your windows onto the night-sky - what is that, rotating east? A great black dot: not a satellite and not a bird… Waveforms, as if a great black void of space was chewing at itself. Pattern ideas, something you cannot place, taste or place a finger on; something hidden from the senses - and turning in on itself, as if a vortex of a fractal source was feeding back on its own strange encodings, and transferring out.

What the hell is it? Aurora of the past decade: fading imprints of another reality, invisible except to telescopes and eavesdroppers. Do you feel coded, hacked? Is this the right zone to get involved - in the worlds of the time-travelers and slumming Knights Psynergy? There is a sense of terror mixed with awe, an anticipation that comes as one stares at something so purely dangerous. Exhilaration at both the image’s terror and its beauty. Perhaps we should not observe the unknown so closely after all: our laws of reason and biology may be violated in some way… or then again, reality as we know it may be disintegrating. Who knows.

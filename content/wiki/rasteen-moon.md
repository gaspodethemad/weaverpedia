## Overview

**Rasteen Moon** is a lunar celestial body discovered and identified by **Sunwatch** forces during the previous days of Old Sunwatch. Officially, the Sunwatch Command researches feasible celestial posthuman entities and adaptive structures conforming to Sunwatch doctrines and purposes even at inaccessible borders of reality. However, Sunwatch black projects - hyperstitional initiatives codified as secret branches of official Sunwatch agendas - pioneered the research on Rasteen Moon.

The primary project object at Rasteen Moon was to further advance ultrasurface programming with the purpose of creating dreamwaves from effectively conscious amoebic AIs. The idea was to encode action plans, strategic priorities, and overarching narratives from direct manifestations from the active subconscious (meme) realm, fusing ultimate algorithmic logic into Sunwatch purposes, making secret Sunwatch intents a part of the unconscious morphogenetic fields and processes of natural worlds. Mainly, these experiments were technological, but involved more and more "spiritual" cognition equivalents as they evolved.

The moon was tunneled into, hundreds of warren-like colonies connected with gigantic stairwells, a network of tunnels creating a lattice through the moon, with the sole purpose to grow the ultrasurface AIs in the purest environment with maximal control over its quasi-organic environment. Artificial shields barricaded the projects from observers' eyes; the tunnels stabilized, advanced, and imposed structures onto the lunar growing basin, creating the ultimate ultrasurface: one whole pulsating, dreamwave creating, hyperstitionally responsive singular organism: the moon of Rasteen.

But, as it was the case with most of the posthuman-overlord and biorider technological ambitions, hallucinatory energies enhanced, enabled and in fact intentionally blurred the line between reality and pure simulation. Rasteen Moon, or rather the new mind of Rasteen, developed into an erratic, hyperstitional ultra-entity, refracting data, solar radiation, and chaotic simulation from the ecosystem of the alien deepness itself, becoming a hive of aetherghosts and indistinct, schemantic inter-signal structures. Taken over by entities of semi-sentient lightning and virulent white-fire matrices, this dreamwave-producing moon morphed its already addictive proto-AIs into unbound fields of perception and cognition, becoming itself ambient dream-flows and quasi-reality constructs.

Sunwatch Command gave up and abandoned the Rasteen Moon projects, halting their metamemetic/ultrasurface research altogether and never mentioning their catatonic foregone entities stabilizing the flux into dreamlife again. But whispers of an indescribable, treacherous, and dangerously radiant otherworld of living cinder walls fortified with latent dream energies in an impenetrable carapace who never sleep would always attract the interest of rogue researchers and cult-engineers everywhere.
